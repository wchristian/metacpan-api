=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $mcpan  = MetaCPAN::API->new();
    my $author = $mcpan->author('XSAWYERX');
    my $dist   = $mcpan->release( distribution => 'MetaCPAN-API' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a hopefully-complete API-compliant interface to MetaCPAN
(L<https://metacpan.org>) with DWIM capabilities, to make your life easier.

This module has three purposes:

=over 4

=item * Provide 100% of the beta MetaCPAN API

This module will be updated regularly on every MetaCPAN API change, and intends
to provide the user with as much of the API as possible, no shortcuts. If it's
documented in the API, you should be able to do it.

Because of this design decision, this module has an official MetaCPAN namespace
with the blessing of the MetaCPAN developers.

Notice this module currently only provides the beta API, not the old
soon-to-be-deprecated API.

=item * Be lightweight, to allow flexible usage

While many modules would help make writing easier, it's important to take into
account how they affect your compile-time, run-time and overall memory
consumption.

By providing a slim interface implementation, more users are able to use this
module, such as long-running processes (like daemons), CLI or GUI applications,
cron jobs, and more.

=item * DWIM

While it's possible to access the methods defined by the API spec, there's still
a matter of what you're really trying to achieve. For example, when searching
for I<"Dave">, you want to find both I<Dave Cross> and I<Dave Rolsky> (and any
other I<Dave>), but you also want to search for a PAUSE ID of I<DAVE>, if one
exists.

This is where DWIM comes in. This module provides you with additional generic
methods which will try to do what they think you want.

Of course, this does not prevent you from manually using the API methods. You
still have full control over that, if that's what you wish.

You can (and should) read up on the generic methods, which will explain how
their DWIMish nature works, and what searches they run.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 base_url

    my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::API->new(
        base_url => 'http://localhost:9999',
    );

This attribute is used for REST requests. You should set it to where the
MetaCPAN is accessible. By default it's already set correctly, but if you're
running a local instance of MetaCPAN, or use a local mirror, or tunnel it
through a local port, or any of those stuff, you would want to change this.

Default: I<http://api.metacpan.org/v0>.

This attribute is read-only (immutable), meaning that once it's set on
initialize (via C<new()>), you cannot change it. If you need to, create a
new instance of MetaCPAN::API. Why is it immutable? Because it's better.

=head2 ua

This attribute is used to contain the user agent used for running the REST
request to the server. It is specifically set to L<HTTP::Tiny>, so if you
want to set it manually, make sure it's of HTTP::Tiny.

HTTP::Tiny is used as part of the philosophy of keeping it tiny.

This attribute is read-only (immutable), meaning that once it's set on
initialize (via C<new()>), you cannot change it. If you need to, create a
new instance of MetaCPAN::API. Why is it immutable? Because it's better.

=head2 ua_args

    my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::API->new(
        ua_args => [ agent => 'MyAgent' ],
    );

The arguments that will be given to the L<HTTP::Tiny> user agent.

This attribute is read-only (immutable), meaning that once it's set on
initialize (via C<new()>), you cannot change it. If you need to, create a
new instance of MetaCPAN::API. Why is it immutable? Because it's better.

The default is a user agent string: B<MetaCPAN::API/$version>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 fetch

    my $result = $mcpan->fetch('/release/distribution/Moose');

    # with parameters
    my $more = $mcpan->fetch(
        '/release/distribution/Moose',
        param => 'value',
    );

This is a helper method for API implementations. It fetches a path from
MetaCPAN, decodes the JSON from the content variable and returns it.

You don't really need to use it, but you can in case you want to write your
own extension implementation to MetaCPAN::API.

It accepts an additional hash as C<GET> parameters.

=head2 post

    # /release&content={"query":{"match_all":{}},"filter":{"prefix":{"archive":"Cache-Cache-1.06"}}}
    my $result = $mcpan->fetch(
        'release',
        {
            query  => { match_all => {} },
            filter => { prefix => { archive => 'Cache-Cache-1.06' } },
        },
    );

The POST equivalent of the C<fetch()> method. It gets the path and JSON request.
